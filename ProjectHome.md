The script that is developed here is aimed to calculate thermodynamic cycles.
It is given a set of initial values (pressures, specific volumes, temperatures, etc.) at certain points and/or types of state changes inbetween (isobaric, polytropic, etc.) and an order in which these points are passed during the cycle.
From this information the script calculates the missing state variables (pressures, specific volumes, temperatures,etc) and the total mass specific work output and efficiency of the thermodynamic cycle process.
